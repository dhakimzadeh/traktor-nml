traktor-nml
===========

PHP library to read and write Traktor NML files

Notes:
This project was started on 21st January 2013 against traktor version 2.5.0 R13954 which
uses version 15 of the NML format. This is the lowest version of NML that will be supported.

This project is in development as a standalone extension to provide traktor nml file reading and writing to the https://github.com/jaetask/djtools project.
